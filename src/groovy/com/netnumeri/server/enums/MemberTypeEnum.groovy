    /*
    Chairperson - chairs club meetings, co-ordinates the other club members and ensures that each club member has their
    say and fulfills their commitments to the investment club

Treasurer - manages monthly member subscriptions, withdrawals, unit valuation, income/expenditure book keeping and
investment club tax returns: such as Form 185(New) in the UK. It is not uncommon for the treasurer to also act as the
club trader

Secretary - keeps a record of the investment club minutes and general club administration

In additon, other roles may be elected as follows:

Assistant Chairperson - to chair and coordinate meetings in the Chairperson's absence.

Assistant Treasurer - to manage subscriptions, unit valuation etc in the Treasurer's absence.
Understanding the unit valuation system and keeping the club's accounts in order can appear quite daunting initially,
so your club might find it helpful to have an Assistant Treasurer 'learning the ropes' and ready to step up to the role
of Treasurer at a later date.

Researcher / Analyst - researches and analyses investment opportunities

Trader - ensures that the investment transactions are executed as agreed at meetings

Auditor - checks the accuracy of the investment club's accounts on an annual basis.
The auditor will ensure that the investment club accounts provide a true and accurate reflection of all the transactions,
subscriptions and investments.
